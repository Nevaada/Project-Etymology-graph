## Decription

### Overview

We intend to create an interactive representation of the etymology of the english dictionary.
The global design idea would be to have an interactive graph of the etymology (nodes:=words, links:=etymology or derived form) along with a navigational search part to look for the etymology of a specific word or look for the words derived from one common root.


### Representation goals 

The goal is to nicely visualize the complex intertwining of the different languages and to highlight the various origins of the english language. The data would mostly grouped by language and more precisely by groups of proximity (find, finding, found would be relatively close in the graph). As the main focus is the english language, would only be represented the words of other languages that are part of the etomology of the english dictionary.
